# NitroMod

The very first GTA V nitro mod (https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/nitromod-in-sp). Released on May 07, 2015.

The code needs major clean ups and optimizations (I was only a junior developer at that point ðŸ˜‚).

# The future

I have many ideas I want to implement into this mod.

### PLANNED

*2.0.1* - **_Forza Horizon-like inspired update_** - **Mid 2022**
- More way to earn bonus nitro points: 
  - Almost hitting other vehicles;
  - Long jumps;
  - Skill system overall.
- Update the UI to get closer to Forza's (it's not going to be the same);
